# Huginn-Dracula
A [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/)-inspired theme for [Huginn](https://github.com/huginn/huginn). It covers most of the design, but there are some sections that haven't been changed (and may not be).

Some sections are not possible to change, such as the diagrams displays due to the way those are rendered.

I also adjusted the font to use Source Sans Pro, as I find that easier to work with.

This should be used with an extension like Stylus on [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/styl-us/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en).
